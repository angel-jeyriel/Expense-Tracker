## ðŸ“Š Usage

- **Transactions**  
  Add expenses manually via the Livewire form or through the Filament admin panel.  
  Transactions require description, amount, category, and date.

- **Recurring Expenses**  
  Choose `daily`, `weekly`, or `monthly` recurrence.  
  The system automatically calculates the next occurrence date and inserts into the `recurring_expenses` table.

- **Reports**  
  Navigate to the reports page to filter expenses by category or date range.  
  Charts display totals per category and trends over time.

- **Admin (Filament)**  
  Access `/admin` (or your configured panel route) for an intuitive dashboard.  
  Transactions edited here automatically sync recurring expenses.

## ðŸ”§ Development Notes

- **Recurring Expense Logic**  
  - Shared helper `RecurringExpense::calculateNextOccurrence()` determines the next due date.  
  - Filament `CreateTransaction` and `EditTransaction` hooks ensure recurring expenses are created or updated alongside transactions.  
  - Livewire `AddTransaction` component also integrates this logic.

- **Customization**  
  - Categories can be global (shared) or user-specific.  
  - Extend Filament panels to manage budgets and notifications.
